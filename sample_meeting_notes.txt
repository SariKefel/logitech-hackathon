Product Team Meeting Notes - Q4 Planning
Date: November 8, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (Engineering), Jessica (Design), Alex (Marketing)

Agenda:
1. Q4 Product Roadmap Review
2. Local AI Integration Discussion
3. Privacy Features
4. Action Items

Key Discussion Points:

Local AI Integration:
The team discussed implementing on-device AI processing to enhance user privacy. Mike proposed using Ollama for local LLM inference, which would eliminate the need for cloud API calls. The benefits include faster response times, no data transmission to external servers, and zero network latency.

Privacy-First Approach:
Jessica emphasized the importance of privacy in our product design. All user data, including documents and chat history, will remain on the user's device. This aligns with our commitment to user data sovereignty and GDPR compliance.

Performance Benchmarks:
Initial testing shows that local AI responses are 3-5x faster than cloud-based solutions when including network latency. The team agreed this is a significant competitive advantage.

Vector Database Selection:
After evaluating several options, the team selected ChromaDB for local vector storage. It's lightweight, requires no external dependencies, and provides excellent performance for semantic search operations.

Action Items:
1. Mike: Complete prototype implementation by end of week
2. Sarah: Draft product positioning document highlighting privacy features
3. Jessica: Create UI mockups for chat interface with privacy indicators
4. Alex: Prepare demo script for upcoming hackathon presentation
5. All: Test the prototype with real-world documents by Friday

Budget Considerations:
By eliminating cloud API costs, we project savings of $50,000 annually. This will be redirected toward improving on-device model performance and expanding feature set.

Next Steps:
- Schedule follow-up meeting for Friday to review prototype
- Prepare hackathon presentation materials
- Begin user testing with selected beta customers next week
- Finalize Q4 feature priority list by end of month

Technical Requirements:
- Minimum 8GB RAM for optimal performance
- Support for Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Offline-first architecture
- Document processing for TXT, PDF, and CSV formats
- Real-time semantic search across uploaded documents

Success Metrics:
- Response time < 2 seconds for queries
- 95% accuracy in document retrieval
- Zero external API calls during normal operation
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for privacy features
